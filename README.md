# Sprite-Pachinko-Unity-Counting-Prototype
This is part of the Unity Learn Tutorial

Here the player controlls a box and spheres fall from the sky

Your mission is to catch the balls as it falls.
If you miss you fail

There are 3 levels: Easy,Medium and Hard.
Each of the level has a different speed by which the balls fall to the ground.

There is a "Count" text which displays the score

I have also added background music : Gravity Falls Main Theme

All coding was done by me
